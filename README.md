# Calyx

Calyx is a mobile responsive web framework designed to be lightweight, yet just feature rich enough to jump start front end design.

## Pieces of Calyx

### husk.css
Husk.css is a css mobile responsive grid. Like most grids is based on rows with up to 12 columns.

### calyx.css
Calyx.css is the main set of recyclable rules and classes for clean and quick templating. This file can be altered if you want, but it's meant to be rather static.

### style.css
Style.css contains the optional styles that make each site unique. This is the style sheet that's meant to be altered by the end user. In this case we only have a few minimal styles for the main Calyx boiler, which serves as documentation for itself.
